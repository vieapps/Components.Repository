# VIEApps.Components.Repository

The tiny .NET Standard 2.0 polyglot library to help POCO objects work with both NoSQL and SQL databases in the same time (just another ORM-ish library)

- POCO objects can be stored in both NoSQL database (MongoDB) and SQL database (Microsoft SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and ODBC) at the same time as individual objects or synced objects
- Attributes/Columns are mapped like ActiveRecord acts
- Have built-in extended properties
- Integrated with caching component [VIEApps.Components.Caching](https://github.com/vieapps/Components.Caching) to reduce all I/O round trips
- Built-in serializations with JSON and XML
- Fully async with distributed transactions supported (SQL)
